# Regulating the Taxicab Market in the Smartphone Era

###### December 2015

For traditional taxi drivers and companies, ridesourcing services like Lyft and Uber represent unfair competition, exempt from regulation of the taxicab market. Historically, regulation has however been prompted by drivers and companies themselves. 

In this project, I went back to the source of the current regulation in New York City, and investigated whether new technologies have weakened the old rationale. To do so, I used public usage data of Uber and taxis to infer the characteristics of both user populations, 

I find a growing divergence between users of Uber and taxis over time. Ridesourcing applications have given access of taxi services to a more diverse population. 

The fact that Lyft, Uber and co. have been able to pull this off without the help of old regulatory crutches signals that old regulation is obsolete, and that a new framework is needed.
